# Advanced topics in Machine Learning

## Prerequisites
- Introducotry Machine Learning
- Model training and optimization

## Course learning outcomes
In this course, we will learn some advanced machine learning topics in the context of new architectures, efficient model design, and different deployment strategies. We will cover some model architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Then we will discuss efficient model design techniques like pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, etc. Finally, we will cover some strategies for efficient ML model deployment for inference on different hardware.


Broadly explain Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and different types of RNNs
Broadly explain the idea of self-attention and transformers
Broadly explain Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Describe pruning and able to design a pruning strategy
Describe quantization and able to compress models using quantization
Broadly explain knowledge distillation and train a small model
Explain different strategies to deploy ml models on different hardware for inference
